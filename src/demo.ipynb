    "# Litepose \n",
    "[Litepose][1] proposes an efficient way to perform multi-person pose estimation, providing a low computational cost, scale-invariant and reliable architecture. It follows a bottom-up approach, namely it uses just one network to do both keypoints estimation and grouping. In this implementation I have also relied on two other papers (also cited by Litepose), one is [HigherHRNet][2] which proposes the main architecture and the other is [Associative Embedding][3] which introduces a way to assign identity-free keypoints to the person they belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Litepose modifies the HigherHRNet architecture going from a multi-branch to a single-branch one by gradual shrinking with the purpose of speeding up the inference, making it run on low computational power devices as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture uses a MobileNet backbone with **Large Kernel Convolutions** that have shown great results empirically. The backbone output is passed to multiple deconvolutional (transpose convolutional) blocks implementing the main feature of the Litepose Paper which is **Fusion Deconv Head**. This allows obtaining scale-aware results by merging backbone intermediate features and refined features, in this way the network can exploit high resolution features, that help to catch close joints and small person, without involving a multi-branch architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $t$ be the number of convolutional blocks and $n$ be the number of the current deconvolutional block, the features fusion is implemented by summing the features of deconvolutional block in position $n$ with the features of backbone block in position $t-n-1$, refined by an additional convolutional layer. Eventually the merged features are passed to a final block for each deconvolutional layer that produces the output. The results of the network are provided in several scales, one for each deconvolutional layer. Hence the output is a $(n,j,s_i,s_i)$ tensor where $n$ is the number of scales (i.e. deconv blocks), $j$ is the number of joints that we want to detect, $s_i$ for $i\\in{1,2,...,n}$ is the size of the current scale. The image clarifies the network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Network Architecture!](../assets/structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the network is composed of a list of scaled versions of multi-channel results. Each result has $2*k$ channels, where $k$ is the number of joints for each person. The first $k$ channels have to be intended as a 2D probability distribution for each joint, since the model also works for multi-person detections, the distributions will have multiple peaks (hopefully one for each person). The last k channels, called **tags**, are used to assign identity free keypoints to each person, i.e. connect the keypoints together. The main idea behind tags is that two keypoints are connected to each other if their tags are the closest among every possible pair.\n",
